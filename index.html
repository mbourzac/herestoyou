          Just over a year ago, I found myself dissatisfied with the way my career was going, unhappy with my weight and needing 
          to make a change. I was working full time and wanted to make home cooked healthy organic foods, find time to exercise 
          regularly and still enjoy time for myself and family. It was then that I heard about health coaching and decided this 
          was the career for me. Not only could I better myself, but I could extend the same to others to help them improve 
          their lives.

          Health is not just about the food we eat, it is also about the way we live our lives, the jobs we perform and
            how we spend our free time. If we are unhappy in one area of our lives, eventually it spills over and affects 
            all areas of our lives. Because how we do one thing is how we do everything. When I realized this in my own 
            life, I knew I needed to recommit to live a healthier life both physically and mentally.

          Today I find myself still on a journey that began a while ago; a journey that continues to explore healthy 
            foods and healthy living, and what that looks like for me in my life. A journey that is committed to regular 
            exercise, making healthy food choices, spending time with family and volunteering in my community.
