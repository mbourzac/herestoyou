        <h2>Setting up a workshop or speaking event</h2>


<p>As you can see, Sheryl’s passion is working with individuals and groups and empowering people to care for themselves in 
          such a way as to be healthy at any age.  Aging does not mean illness. The people who resonate most with her 
          will be those who desire to stay healthy, those who desire to learn new and simple ways in which to enhance and 
          improve their health and those looking to reduce stress and improve their sleep habits.</p>

<p>Sheryl loves speaking in yoga studios, churches, businesses and communities that are open to healthy aging and eliminating 
          chronic disease.  She hopes to give them value and something that they can apply to their lives right away.  
          Her speaking style is natural, authentic, and interactive.  She is comfortable speaking to groups from small to 
  moderate size.</p>

<p>If you are interested in having her present to your organizations, we would love to connect and work together with you 
          to see what arrangement we can create.  She can deliver anything from a 30-60- minute talk depending on the 
  needs and interests of your group.</p>

        <p>She can’t wait to co-create with you and your group.</p>
